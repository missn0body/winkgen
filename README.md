# winkgen

A sly little key generator, *wink*.  
First written by anson in June 2020.

This terminal application allows you to generate
OEM and CD keys of a specific variety, reminiscent
of a large software company that is owned by a 
quite notable bill.

Please read [here](https://gurney.dev/posts/mod7/) for more information on the key
generation itself.

Usage and options can be read by invoking `winkgen --help` at the
command line. This project is licensed under the MIT License, See

### v.1.0.0 (First release)

Run this application at the command line and it
will generate one legal OEM key and one legal CD key,
free of charge.

### v.1.0.2

(September 21, 2023)  
Added command-line arguments, and selection between
generating OEM and CD keys. However this program will
not operate without command-line arguments.
